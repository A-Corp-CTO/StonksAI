What should the project look like ?
For now the idea is to create a ML model that is profitable in backtrading thats the global idea

How to find a good strategy ? Can I build ml model to find signals of good trades ?


Steps:
Gather data for all the SP-500 stocks from 2010 onwards
Or we could also look at the stocks with the highest volume but they'll probably be very similar.

Build more features SMA, remember all the things used previously.

Try and build a few models and backtest them and optimise for roi 

Implement best model to a real time trading account with little money to see how it performs.


Ideas:

Stocks vs Forex vs Crypto

Which one is the easiest to get the data ?


TA or Fundamental analysis for stocks
